## About the project

Create a web of a tattoo studio. This project includes only the frontend part in which I used React. It is part of a Fullstack project in which I made a functional API connected to a MySQL database (you can see it here).

In the landing page you can see links to the services and the catalog that the studio has and you can register and login.

If you are logged as a normal user you can edit your profile and see and create your appointments.

If you are logged as a super_admin you can see, create, update and delete the services that the shop can offer.

The super admin role can create new services, add images to the catalog, add new tatoo artists and change roles to users if needed.

As super_admin you can also see all pending appointments of the shop and you can search for any client using different filters: name, email and rol(if you want to filter for user or tattoo_artist)

## Local installation

1. Clone the repository
` $ git clone https://github.com/Javi-Gallego/FSD_Proyecto6.git `
2. Install dependencies
` $ npm install `
3. Run React project
` $ npm run dev `

Unfortunately, the server is hosted on a free site and it is very likely that is not online the moment you want to see this project. In this link you have the repository (an Express made server working with a MySQL database) and the instructions to install it locally:
https://github.com/Javi-Gallego/FSD_Proyecto4.git

If you need to run the server locally, you will need to go to /src/services/apiCalls.js and put the right urlRoot.

## Problems solutions
I could not erase fields that were already written.

If we update an appointment of a service that has tattoo artist and a tattoo image from the catalog and change that appointment to do a piercing, the obvious thing is to change the service_id and delete the artist_id and tattoo_id that are no longer needed, but I could not do that.

I thought of an internal convention to change the artist_id to one named "worker" that points to a king of default worker and to a tattoo_id that points to a tattoo named "no tattoo selected".

## Future features
[ ] Tattoo artists can also make and update appointments on their own.
[ ] Add reviews to the artists based on user experiences
[ ] Add a rating system to the catalog and filter or order based on this rating.
[ ] Maybe, to buy a piercing you do not need to make an appointment, just go to the shop. So you can see the service but cannot make an appointment with that service.
[ ] Add piercings images to the catalog.
[ ] Add role for piercing artists if they are different from the tattoo ones, add another role for the artists than can do both.
[ ] Add a frontend so the users can interact with the API.

## Development:

``` js
 const developer = "Javier Gallego";

 console.log("Desarrollado por: " + developer);
```
